# Proyecto API Modular - GCR + Vercel

Este proyecto tiene una estructura modular escalable y expandible y por ahora contiene 3 microservicios desplegables en Google Cloud Run, además de un frontend que se despliega en Vercel.

## Microservicios actuales
- `/consumo-service` - Calcula consumo energético
- `/footprint-service` - Calcula huella de carbono
- `/solar-service` - Calcula producción solar

## API Gateway
- Reenvía solicitudes a cada microservicio

## Frontend
- HTML, JS y CSS desplegados en Vercel
